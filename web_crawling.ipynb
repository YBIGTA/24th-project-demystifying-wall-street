       "\"Last week, you might have seen that DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA (ETR:DWS) released its annual result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.6% to €35.72 in the past week. Revenues of €2.6b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at €2.83, missing estimates by 3.0%. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. Check out our latest analysis for DWS Group GmbH KGaA Following last week's earnings report, DWS Group GmbH KGaA's eleven analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be €2.65b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to grow 11% to €3.13. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of €2.72b and earnings per share (EPS) of €3.29 in 2024. It's pretty clear that pessimism has reared its head after the latest results, leading to a weaker revenue outlook and a minor downgrade to earnings per share estimates. Despite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the €40.84 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values DWS Group GmbH KGaA at €57.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €32.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that DWS Group GmbH KGaA's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 1.5% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 4.0% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 5.6% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than DWS Group GmbH KGaA.      Related Quotes\""

       "'With ETFs, you can go along for the ride—or, perhaps, get taken for a ride. The typical exchange-traded fund is cheaper, performs better and produces lower tax bills than its ancestor, the mutual fund. As a result, investors have replaced mutual funds with ETFs en masse. Fund companies are feverishly working on plans to slow that outflow. At passive, market-tracking index funds, the ultimate result will probably be even lower costs and tax bills. At underperforming active funds, it could entrap disgruntled investors and keep them from voting with their feet. You’ll have to guard against the possibility that ETFs might not work for you—but against you.'"

Investors ought to consider the insight of top Wall Street pros as they hunt for dividend stocks with solid fundamentals.\\n\\nHere are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street\\'s top experts on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\\n\\nFirst up is telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ), which recently reported its fourth-quarter results and impressed investors with the robust jump in wireless postpaid phone subscriber additions.\\n\\nIn 2023, the company raised its dividend for the 17th consecutive year. Verizon\\'s quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share (annualized dividend of $2.66), reflects a yield of 6.7%.\\n\\nFollowing Verizon\\'s Q4 results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $50 per share from $45. The analyst noted that the company delivered strong subscriber and cash flow growth in 2023, with further acceleration expected this year.\\n\\n\"Ongoing 5G and fixed wireless broadband momentum and increased services offerings combined with operating efficiencies and margin improvement will drive a reacceleration in cash flow growth and improving Business Performance trends,\" said Feinseth.\\n\\nThe analyst thinks that Verizon\\'s solid balance sheet and cash flow support the company\\'s ongoing investments in spectrum expansion and other growth initiatives as well as dividend hikes. Overall, he thinks that the company offers a compelling investment opportunity, given its high dividend yield and industry-leading position that enables it to benefit from long-term telecom trends.\\n\\nFeinseth ranks No. 214 among more than 8,700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Verizon Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks)\\n\\nThis week\\'s second dividend pick is Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), a master limited partnership that provides midstream energy services. Last month, the company announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.515 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2023, to be paid on Feb. 14. This quarterly distribution marks a 5.1% year-over-year increase and reflects a yield of nearly 8%.\\n\\nIn reaction to EPD\\'s fourth-quarter results, Stifel analyst Selman Akyol reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and raised the price target to $36 per share from $35. The analyst stated that Q4 2023 results slightly surpassed his expectations. He increased his 2024 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization estimate by more than 2%, mainly due to the company\\'s natural gas liquids pipeline segment.\\n\\nFurther, Akyol anticipates that the momentum in EPD\\'s pipeline and export throughputs will continue in the near term. The analyst also pointed out that EPD has increased its distributions for 25 years. He expects distributions to be the primary mode of returning capital to unitholders, with buybacks projected to be opportunistic.\\n\\nExplaining his investment stance, Akyol said, \"We believe Enterprise has one of the strongest financial profiles within the midstream sector, and can withstand turbulence from a volatile macro environment.\"\\n\\nAkyol holds the 695th position among more than 8,700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 5%. (See EPD Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks)\\n\\nOur third dividend pick is another midstream energy player, MPLX LP (MPLX). Last month, the master limited partnership announced a quarterly distribution of 85 cents per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2023, payable on Feb. 14. MPLX offers a dividend yield of 9%.\\n\\nBased on the recently announced fourth-quarter results, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on MPLX stock and increased the price target to $46 per share from $45. The analyst noted that the company\\'s Q4 2023 adjusted EBITDA surpassed consensus expectations by 4%, thanks to increased product volumes, higher pipeline rates in the logistics and storage segment, and higher processing volumes in the gathering and processing unit.\\n\\nGiven the high yield offered by the stock, Scotto thinks that MPLX remains one of the most attractive income plays in the large-cap MLP space. The analyst expects a cash distribution of $3.57 per unit in 2024 and $3.84 per unit in 2025. That\\'s up from $3.40 in 2023.\\n\\nScotto thinks that \"future cash flow generation in conjunction with the financial flexibility provided by decreasing leverage and adequate distribution coverage can drive incremental capital returns to investors over time.\"\\n\\nScotto ranks No. 83 among more than 8,700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 17.8%. (See MPLX Technical Analysis on TipRanks)', 'screenshotUrl': None}\n"

       "'A strong fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and it\\'s time for dividend-paying companies to shine.Resilient dividend-paying companies can offer long-term growth potential and steady income. Investors ought to consider the insight of top Wall Street pros as they hunt for dividend stocks with solid fundamentals.Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street\\'s top experts on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.First up is telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ), which recently reported its fourth-quarter results and impressed investors with the robust jump in wireless postpaid phone subscriber additions.In 2023, the company raised its dividend for the 17th consecutive year. Verizon\\'s quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share (annualized dividend of $2.66), reflects a yield of 6.7%.Following Verizon\\'s Q4 results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $50 per share from $45. The analyst noted that the company delivered strong subscriber and cash flow growth in 2023, with further acceleration expected this year.\"Ongoing 5G and fixed wireless broadband momentum and increased services offerings combined with operating efficiencies and margin improvement will drive a reacceleration in cash flow growth and improving Business Performance trends,\" said Feinseth.The analyst thinks that Verizon\\'s solid balance sheet and cash flow support the company\\'s ongoing investments in spectrum expansion and other growth initiatives as well as dividend hikes. Overall, he thinks that the company offers a compelling investment opportunity, given its high dividend yield and industry-leading position that enables it to benefit from long-term telecom trends.Feinseth ranks No. 214 among more than 8,700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Verizon Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks)This week\\'s second dividend pick is Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), a master limited partnership that provides midstream energy services. Last month, the company announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.515 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2023, to be paid on Feb. 14. This quarterly distribution marks a 5.1% year-over-year increase and reflects a yield of nearly 8%.In reaction to EPD\\'s fourth-quarter results, Stifel analyst Selman Akyol reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and raised the price target to $36 per share from $35. The analyst stated that Q4 2023 results slightly surpassed his expectations. He increased his 2024 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization estimate by more than 2%, mainly due to the company\\'s natural gas liquids pipeline segment.Further, Akyol anticipates that the momentum in EPD\\'s pipeline and export throughputs will continue in the near term. The analyst also pointed out that EPD has increased its distributions for 25 years. He expects distributions to be the primary mode of returning capital to unitholders, with buybacks projected to be opportunistic.Explaining his investment stance, Akyol said, \"We believe Enterprise has one of the strongest financial profiles within the midstream sector, and can withstand turbulence from a volatile macro environment.\"Akyol holds the 695th position among more than 8,700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 5%. (See EPD Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks)Our third dividend pick is another midstream energy player, MPLX LP (MPLX). Last month, the master limited partnership announced a quarterly distribution of 85 cents per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2023, payable on Feb. 14. MPLX offers a dividend yield of 9%.Based on the recently announced fourth-quarter results, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on MPLX stock and increased the price target to $46 per share from $45. The analyst noted that the company\\'s Q4 2023 adjusted EBITDA surpassed consensus expectations by 4%, thanks to increased product volumes, higher pipeline rates in the logistics and storage segment, and higher processing volumes in the gathering and processing unit.Given the high yield offered by the stock, Scotto thinks that MPLX remains one of the most attractive income plays in the large-cap MLP space. The analyst expects a cash distribution of $3.57 per unit in 2024 and $3.84 per unit in 2025. That\\'s up from $3.40 in 2023.Scotto thinks that \"future cash flow generation in conjunction with the financial flexibility provided by decreasing leverage and adequate distribution coverage can drive incremental capital returns to investors over time.\"Scotto ranks No. 83 among more than 8,700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 17.8%. (See MPLX Technical Analysis on TipRanks)'"

       "'Nvidia’s largest customers (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI) are developing AI chips that compete with Nvidia, presenting a potential long-term threat to the AI leader. Jensen’s response? “We can help you do that.”  Warning: this blog contains speculation that has not been verified.... But fun to think about!  When I was working at AMD, I was always impressed with how the company managed to keep two teams in complete isolation from each other to protect client confidentiality. One team was designing the next chip for the Microsoft XBox, while the other was designing a chip for the Sony Playstation. Each client had their own gaming console intellectual property and requirements which had to be protected from the other team. It was a successful model for AMD, who still owns that market.  But all that secrecy can be difficult and expensive. And it is hard to scale that business. What if the chip vendor let the customer do more of the design work, and provide their IP for inclusion into the customers’ chips? And of course, the client could leverage the vendors relationship with TSMC or Samsung for fabrication to lower costs and improve time to market.  So it should surprise exactly nobody that Nvidia has announced it formed a group tasked with forging this new business model, helping clients build their own solution using Nvidia IP or perhaps even chiplets. Nvidia is up yet another 3% on the news.  Perhaps Nvidia didn’t need to buy Arm after all. With this move, it is beginning to build an AI licensing giant.  I’m sure we will hear more about this at GTC next month, but here is our perspective.  Many companies who design their own chips to lower cost or provide a more bespoke solution to their computational needs already partner with companies like Broadcomm and Marvell for back-end physical design, SerDes blocks, or IP such as Marvell’s high-performance Arm CPU cores. And EDA solution providers like Cadence and Synopsys make a good business of providing blocks of IP that SOC designers can drop into their chips, saving money and speeding time to market. But this is not new news. Sima.ai, for example, uses an image processor from Synopsys in its edge AI chip.  Startup Tenstorrent, led by Jim Keller, saw this opportunity coming, and has pivoted the Toronto- and Austin-based company from a potential Nvidia competitor to an IP and design shop, provide chiplets and intellectual property to companies like Kia and LG.  In the world of AI, we are seeing a new trend, where designers of TVs or cars or networking equipment want to build a bespoke solution to lower costs or provide a differentiated solution including AI, but they don’t have the need or expertise to build the whole chip. Google, Amazon AWS, Meta (projected to use their own chip later this year), and Microsoft Azure already have their own custom chips for in-house AI alongside their Nvidia GPUs for cloud customers. Could they partner with Nvidia for future designs?  Could these Nvidia custom-chip clients tap into Nvidia’s in-house and AWS supercomputers to accelerate and optimize those design efforts? It would be a nice piece of additional revenue as well as an incredible differentiator. If so, this could be why Nvidia is hosting their latest “internal” supercomputer, Project Cieba, at AWS data centers, where the infrastructure for secure cloud services are already available. Nvidia could make chip design optimization services available on Cieba.  While this speculation may be a bridge too far, doing so would indicate that Nvidia sees the writing on the wall, and is already gearing up to transform the industry once again.  Ok, perhaps I went to far in my speculations. But if any company can pull this off, it would be Nvidia. All tech commoditizes over time, especially previous generations of silicon. When Nvidia was courting Arm, I often said the acquisition would give Nvidia the possibility of monetizing that which they do not want to productize, through licensing deals.  Looks like thats exactly what Nvidia is doing now.'"
